# Introduction
Startups play a central role in innovation and economic growth, yet their funding paths and eventual outcomes vary widely across industries, time periods, and levels of investment. Understanding how these factors interact is important for founders, investors, and policymakers, but broad patterns are often difficult to see without systematic exploration of data. In this project, we analyze a venture capital dataset containing nearly 50,000 startups to investigate how funding intensity, founding cohorts, and market context relate to startup outcomes such as continuing operations, acquisition, or closure. Rather than attempting to predict success, the goal of this exploratory data analysis is to identify structural trends and heterogeneity in startup trajectories, including how outcomes differ across industries, how funding accumulates over time, and how older and younger cohorts compare. By focusing on descriptive patterns, this analysis helps to provide an accessible overview of the venture ecosystem for readers without prior familiarity with startup financing.
