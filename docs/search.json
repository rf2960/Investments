    "text": "1 Introduction\nStartups play a central role in innovation and economic growth, yet their funding paths and eventual outcomes vary widely across industries, time periods, and levels of investment. Understanding how these factors interact is important for founders, investors, and policymakers, but broad patterns are often difficult to see without systematic exploration of data. In this project, we analyze a venture capital dataset containing nearly 50,000 startups to investigate how funding intensity, founding cohorts, and market context relate to startup outcomes such as continuing operations, acquisition, or closure. Rather than attempting to predict success, the goal of this exploratory data analysis is to identify structural trends and heterogeneity in startup trajectories, including how outcomes differ across industries, how funding accumulates over time, and how older and younger cohorts compare. By focusing on descriptive patterns, this analysis helps to provide an accessible overview of the venture ecosystem for readers without prior familiarity with startup financing.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset used in this project is the Startup Investments dataset documented by Crunchbase, publicly available on Github (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notpeter/crunchbase-data/master/investments.csv), containing venture-backed startup information originally compiled from the Crunchbase platform and redistributed through an open data repository. The dataset represents a snapshot rather than a continuously updated feed and includes firm-level records collected by Crunchbase through self-reporting by companies, investor disclosures, and public announcements. The CSV file contains approximately 50,000 startups and 40 variables, including founding year, market category, geographic location, funding totals, number of funding rounds, and final company status (e.g., operating, acquired, closed, IPO). Each row corresponds to a single startup, with funding information aggregated across its lifetime rather than reported at a transactional level. Because the data are a static snapshot, they do not reflect real-time updates, and younger companies are more likely to appear as “operating,” introducing survivorship and censoring effects. Additional data quality issues include missing values in founding dates and funding fields, inconsistent market labels, and the absence of small or unreported startups that never appear in venture databases.",

Location and founding information have substantial missingness (e.g., state_code, city, founded_year, founded_month, founded_quarter). Core variables for our analysis, including status, funding_total_usd, and name, are mostly observed, with only a small fraction of missing status (~2–3% of rows).\n\n\nCode\nfounded_missing_by_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  group_by(status) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    prop_missing_founded_year = mean(is.na(founded_year)),\n    n = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\ngg_miss_status &lt;- ggplot(\n  founded_missing_by_status,\n  aes(x = status, y = prop_missing_founded_year, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_col(\n    width = 0.7,\n    alpha = 0.9\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Missing Founded Year Is Similar Across Startup Outcomes\",\n    subtitle = \"Share of startups with missing founded_year within each status category\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Missing founded_year (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x   = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"  \n  )\n\ngg_miss_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure focuses specifically on the founding year variable and shows that the proportion of startups with missing founding dates is relatively similar across outcome categories, ranging from roughly 20% to 25% for acquired, closed, and operating firms. Although startups with missing or unknown status show slightly higher missingness about 30%, the overall similarity across outcomes suggests that missing founding-year information is unlikely to bias comparisons of outcomes over time.\nTogether, these results indicate that while missing data are common—particularly in funding-related fields—their distribution is largely consistent across status categories, allowing downstream exploratory analyses to remain interpretable with appropriate filtering and caution.",

Funding intensity and industry context are strongly associated with outcomes, with older cohorts and heavily funded startups more likely to experience exits. These patterns suggest that time, fundraising depth, and market segment jointly shape startup trajectories.\n\n\nCode\ngg_founded_year &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(founded_year)) |&gt;\n  count(founded_year) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = founded_year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line(\n    linewidth = 1.2,\n    color = \"#4C72B0\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 2.4,\n    color = \"#4C72B0\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy  = 1\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Startup Foundings Accelerated in the Mid-2000s\",\n    subtitle = \"Number of startups founded by year\",\n    x = \"Year founded\",\n    y = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\ngg_founded_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sharp rise in startup foundings in the 2000s highlights a structural shift in entrepreneurial activity, though the apparent decline in the most recent years likely reflects data truncation rather than a true drop in formation.\n\n\nCode\ntop_markets &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  count(market, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(market)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 15)\n\ngg_top_markets &lt;- ggplot(\n  top_markets,\n  aes(x = fct_reorder(market, n), y = n)\n) +\n  geom_col(\n    fill  = \"#4C72B0\",\n    alpha = 0.9,\n    width = 0.75\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy  = 1\n    ),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Software and Biotech Take the Greatest Market Share\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 15 markets by number of startups\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.text.x   = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor   = element_blank()\n  )\n\ngg_top_markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dominance of software and biotechnology reflects both the scalability of digital products and strong investor interest in technology-driven sectors.\n\n\nCode\nstatus_counts &lt;- startup |&gt; \n  count(status)\n\ngg_status_counts &lt;- ggplot(\n  status_counts,\n  aes(x = status, y = n, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"), accuracy = 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Most Startups in the Sample Are Still Operating\",\n    subtitle = \"Count of startups by current Crunchbase status\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title   = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle= element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\"   # optional but clean here\n  )\n\ngg_status_counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating startups dominate the dataset, reflecting both the prevalence of ongoing firms and the fact that many startups have not yet reached an exit outcome.\n\n\nCode\nstartup_year_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(founded_year), status != \"unknown\") |&gt;\n  count(status, founded_year)\n\ngg_facet_year_status &lt;- ggplot(\n  startup_year_status,\n  aes(x = founded_year, y = n, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_col(\n    alpha = 0.9,\n    width = 0.85\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  facet_wrap(~ status, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Startup Founding Trends Differ Across Outcomes\",\n    subtitle = \"Number of startups founded per year, separated by final status\",\n    x        = \"Year founded\",\n    y        = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x   = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n    strip.text    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\ngg_facet_year_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup founding activity differs sharply across outcomes and over time. Acquired startups are heavily concentrated in earlier founding years, reflecting the long time horizons required for exits or failure to materialize. In contrast, operating startups are overwhelmingly founded in more recent years, driven by the rapid expansion of entrepreneurial activity in the late 1990s and 2000s. This divergence highlights a key survivorship dynamic in startup data: many newer firms are still classified as operating not because they are more successful, but because they have not yet had sufficient time to exit.

Startups founded in earlier periods are more likely to progress beyond a single funding round and ultimately reach an acquisition or closure, while more recent cohorts overwhelmingly remain operating, reflecting limited time for exits to occur. Across cohorts, startups with only one funding round are much more likely to remain operating or close, whereas those that raise multiple rounds are disproportionately represented among acquisitions. Overall, the figure suggests that funding intensity acts as a key intermediate pathway linking founding period to eventual outcomes, with greater access to capital associated with higher chances of successful exits.\n\n\nCode\nstartup_facet &lt;- startup |&gt; \n  filter(funding_total_usd &gt; 0, !is.na(funding_rounds), !is.na(status)) |&gt; \n  mutate( rounds_bucket = case_when( \n    funding_rounds == 0 ~ \"0 rounds\", \n    funding_rounds == 1 ~ \"1 round\", \n    funding_rounds %in% 2:3 ~ \"2–3 rounds\", \n    funding_rounds &gt;= 4 ~ \"4+ rounds\", \n    TRUE ~ NA_character_ ), \n    rounds_bucket = factor( \n      rounds_bucket, \n      levels = c(\"0 rounds\", \"1 round\", \"2–3 rounds\", \"4+ rounds\") \n      ) \n    ) %&gt;% drop_na(rounds_bucket)\n\ngg_facet_funding_rounds &lt;- ggplot(\n  startup_facet,\n  aes(x = rounds_bucket, y = funding_total_usd, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    width = 0.65,\n    color = \"grey30\",\n    outlier.alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_log10(\n    labels = label_number(\n      prefix    = \"$\",\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy  = 1\n    )\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ status, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"More Funding Rounds Are Associated with Larger Total Investments\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution of total funding by number of rounds, shown separately by startup outcome\",\n    x        = \"Number of funding rounds\",\n    y        = \"Total funding (USD, log scale)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title      = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle   = element_text(size = 10),\n    strip.text      = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11),\n    axis.text.x     = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.y     = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\ngg_facet_funding_rounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all startup outcomes, total funding rises systematically with the number of funding rounds, indicating that companies able to raise repeatedly tend to secure substantially larger cumulative investments. This pattern is especially pronounced for acquired startups, which show both higher medians and upper tails as funding rounds increase, consistent with investors doubling down on firms perceived as successful. Closed startups also exhibit increasing funding with additional rounds, suggesting that raising more capital does not guarantee survival. Among operating startups, the wide spread of funding at higher round counts reflects ongoing uncertainty: while some firms continue to scale rapidly, others accumulate moderate funding without yet reaching a clear exit.",

    "text": "This exploratory analysis reveals that startup outcomes are closely associated with a combination of founding time, funding intensity, and market context, with older and more heavily funded startups more likely to experience acquisition or closure, while newer cohorts remain predominantly operating. At the same time, the findings should be interpreted cautiously due to several limitations, including survivorship and censoring effects in younger firms, substantial missingness in funding-related variables, and the use of aggregated lifetime funding measures that obscure timing and valuation dynamics. Future analyses could extend this work by incorporating longitudinal funding data, firm age explicitly, or external market indicators to better capture temporal and contextual influences on startup trajectories. Overall, this project underscores the value of careful exploratory data analysis, particularly thoughtful visualization and data quality assessment, as a tool for uncovering structural patterns, assessing data limitations, and guiding more rigorous follow-up studies.",
