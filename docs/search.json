    "text": "1 Introduction\nStartups play a central role in innovation and economic growth, yet their funding paths and eventual outcomes vary widely across industries, time periods, and levels of investment. Understanding how these factors interact is important for founders, investors, and policymakers, but broad patterns are often difficult to see without systematic exploration of data. In this project, we analyze a venture capital dataset containing nearly 50,000 startups to investigate how funding intensity, founding cohorts, and market context relate to startup outcomes such as continuing operations, acquisition, or closure. Rather than attempting to predict success, the goal of this exploratory data analysis is to identify structural trends and heterogeneity in startup trajectories, including how outcomes differ across industries, how funding accumulates over time, and how older and younger cohorts compare. By focusing on descriptive patterns, this analysis helps to provide an accessible overview of the venture ecosystem for readers without prior familiarity with startup financing.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset used in this project is the Startup Investments dataset documented by Crunchbase, publicly available on Github (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notpeter/crunchbase-data/master/investments.csv), containing venture-backed startup information originally compiled from the Crunchbase platform and redistributed through an open data repository. The dataset represents a snapshot rather than a continuously updated feed and includes firm-level records collected by Crunchbase through self-reporting by companies, investor disclosures, and public announcements. The CSV file contains approximately 50,000 startups and 40 variables, including founding year, market category, geographic location, funding totals, number of funding rounds, and final company status (e.g., operating, acquired, closed). Each row corresponds to a single startup, with funding information aggregated across its lifetime rather than reported at a transactional level. Because the data are a static snapshot, they do not reflect real-time updates, and younger companies are more likely to appear as “operating,” introducing survivorship and censoring effects. Additional data quality issues include missing values in founding dates and funding fields, inconsistent market labels, and the absence of small or unreported startups that never appear in venture databases.",

Location and founding information have substantial missingness (e.g., state_code, city, founded_year, founded_month, founded_quarter).

Although startups with missing or unknown status show slightly higher missingness about 30%, the overall similarity across outcomes suggests that missing founding-year information is unlikely to bias comparisons of outcomes over time.\nTogether, these results indicate that while missing data are common—particularly in funding-related fields—their distribution is largely consistent across status categories, allowing downstream exploratory analyses to remain interpretable with appropriate filtering and caution.",

A noticeable uptick begins in the late 1990s, coinciding with the growth of the internet and early tech boom.\nThe most striking pattern appears in the mid-2000s to early 2010s: startup formation skyrockets from a few hundred per year to over 5,000 per year at its peak. This surge likely reflects the combination of expanding venture capital availability, the rise of cloud computing (which reduced startup costs), and broader cultural and economic support for entrepreneurship. The sharp drop immediately after the peak may indicate incomplete data for very recent years—startups founded later may not yet be fully captured in the dataset.\nOverall, the graph highlights that startup formation was historically rare but expanded explosively in the 2000s, marking a major shift in the scale and pace of entrepreneurial activity.\n\n\nCode\ntop_markets &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  count(market, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(market)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 15)\n\ngg_top_markets &lt;- ggplot(\n  top_markets,\n  aes(x = fct_reorder(market, n), y = n)\n) +\n  geom_col(\n    fill  = \"#4C72B0\",\n    alpha = 0.9,\n    width = 0.75\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_number(\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy  = 1\n    ),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Software and Biotech Take the Greatest Market Share\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 15 markets by number of startups\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.text.x   = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor   = element_blank()\n  )\n\ngg_top_markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution reveals that Software dominates the startup landscape by a wide margin, with nearly 4,500 companies, which is far more than any other sector. Biotechnology follows as the second-largest market, though its total count still trails Software by a significant gap. These two categories stand out clearly as the major hubs of startup activity.\nBeyond the top two, markets such as Mobile, E-Commerce, and Curated Web form a second tier of sizable but considerably smaller sectors, each hosting roughly 1,000–1,500 startups. The remaining markets, such as Enterprise Software, Health Care, Clean Technology, Games, and Advertising, have progressively fewer startups but still represent meaningful areas of innovation and investment.\nThus, we could tell that a few sectors (especially Software and Biotechnology) account for a disproportionately large share of companies, while many other markets are substantially smaller in scale. This distribution suggests that entrepreneurial activity tends to cluster in domains with either low barriers to entry (Software) or substantial scientific and commercial opportunity (Biotechnology).\n\n\nCode\nstatus_counts &lt;- startup |&gt; \n  count(status)\n\ngg_status_pie &lt;- ggplot(\n  status_counts,\n  aes(x = \"\", y = n, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Most Startups in the Sample Are Still Operating\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution of startups by current Crunchbase status\",\n    fill = \"Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\ngg_status_pie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating startups dominate the data, reflecting both the prevalence of ongoing firms and the fact that many startups have not yet reached an exit outcome.\n\n\n3.2.2 Status-Focus Investigation\n\n\nCode\nstartup_year_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(founded_year), status != \"unknown\") |&gt;\n  count(status, founded_year)\n\ngg_facet_year_status &lt;- ggplot(\n  startup_year_status,\n  aes(x = founded_year, y = n, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_col(\n    alpha = 0.9,\n    width = 0.85\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  facet_wrap(~ status, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Startup Founding Trends Differ Across Outcomes\",\n    subtitle = \"Number of startups founded per year, separated by final status\",\n    x        = \"Year founded\",\n    y        = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x   = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n    strip.text    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\ngg_facet_year_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup founding activity differs across outcomes and over time. Acquired startups are heavily concentrated in earlier founding years, reflecting the long time horizons required for exits or failure to materialize. In contrast, operating startups are overwhelmingly founded in more recent years, driven by the rapid expansion of entrepreneurial activity in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThis divergence highlights a key survivorship bias (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/survivorship-bias/) in startup data: many newer firms are still classified as operating not because they are more successful, but because they have not yet had sufficient time to exit. Together, these panels emphasize the importance of accounting for cohort effects when comparing startup outcomes.\n\n\nCode\ngg_funding_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(funding_total_usd &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = status, y = funding_total_usd, fill = status)) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    color = \"black\",\n    outlier.alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_log10(\n    labels = scales::label_number(\n      prefix = \"$\",\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy = 1\n    ),\n    breaks = c(1e5, 1e6, 1e7, 1e8, 1e9)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Acquired Startups Tend to Raise More Money In General\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution of total funding by status (log scale)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Total funding (USD, log scale)\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\"   # clean, since x already shows status\n  )\n\ngg_funding_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired startups exhibit substantially higher total funding than both closed and still-operating firms, with their median investment level above the other groups. This pattern suggests that larger capital inflows may increase the likelihood of a successful exit: alternatively, that investors concentrate funding in ventures already demonstrating strong traction.\nClosed startups, by contrast, show the lowest funding levels, with a compressed distribution and few high-end outliers. This aligns with the possibility that under-capitalized startups struggle to achieve long-term sustainability or reach attractive exit opportunities.\nOperating startups fall between the two outcomes. On average, they raise more capital than closed firms but remain below the funding levels typical of acquired companies. At the same time, the distribution for operating startups spans a wide range: some achieve exceptionally high funding (sometimes even exceeding that of acquired firms), while a small subset receives very little, falling below the levels seen in many closed firms. This indicates that the “operating” category contains both high-growth winners still scaling and lower-capitalized companies that have yet to reach an inflection point.\nAcross all groups, the broad dispersion of funding, especially on a logarithmic scale, highlights the highly skewed, power-law nature of venture investment, where a small number of firms capture a disproportionately large share of total capital.\n\n\nCode\ntop_market_names &lt;- top_markets$market\n\ngg_market_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(market %in% top_market_names) |&gt;\n  count(market, status) |&gt;\n  group_by(market) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x    = fct_reorder(market, prop),\n      y    = prop,\n      fill = status\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.8) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Most Markets Are Dominated by Operating Startups\",\n    subtitle = \"Within each of the top 15 markets, share of startups by status\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Share of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title  = element_blank()\n  )\n\ngg_market_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross nearly all major markets, operating startups make up the overwhelming majority, highlighting a key structural feature of the startup ecosystem: most firms remain in the active, growth-seeking phase for long periods before reaching an exit event. This dominance of operating firms reflects long exit horizons, especially in sectors like education, health and wellness, biotechnology, where scaling takes time and market consolidation is slower. Yet the distribution of acquired and closed startups varies meaningfully across markets, revealing differences in exit dynamics and market maturity.\nMarkets such as advertising, curated web, and enterprise software show relatively higher acquisition shares, suggesting more active M&A pipelines and stronger integration opportunities with established incumbents. Meanwhile, closure rates, while generally modest, are most pronounced in markets such as games, social media, and curated web, where consumer preferences shift rapidly and competition is especially intense, leading to higher churn.\n\n\nCode\nstatus_levels &lt;- c(\"acquired\", \"closed\", \"operating\")\n\nfounded_status &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(founded_year)) |&gt;\n  # make sure status is a factor with the three levels we expect\n  mutate(status = factor(status, levels = status_levels)) |&gt;\n  count(founded_year, status) |&gt;\n  # ensure we have a row for every year × status, fill missing with 0\n  complete(founded_year, status, fill = list(n = 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(founded_year) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\ngg_founded_status &lt;- ggplot(\n  founded_status,\n  aes(x = founded_year, y = prop, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.85, color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1),\n    limits = c(0, 1),\n    expand = expansion(mult = 0)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Younger Cohorts Have Larger Chance to Be Acquired or Close\",\n    subtitle = \"Share of startups with each outcome by founding year\",\n    x = \"Year founded\",\n    y = \"Share of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title    = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title  = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\ngg_founded_status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the earliest cohorts, roughly from the early 1900s through the 1960s, the large swings in the chart are not meaningful indicators of true trends. Instead, they reflect extremely small sample sizes, sometimes with only one startup founded in a given year. As a result, the proportions jump sharply between 0% and 100%, making these early patterns unreliable for interpretation.\nBeginning around the 1970s, the data becomes dense enough to reveal more stable and interpretable trends. Across these later decades, operating startups consistently make up the largest share within each founding cohort. The share of closed startups gradually increases for more recent cohorts, while the share of acquired startups peaks among those founded in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a period marked by the rise of the internet era and substantial consolidation in the tech sector. This widening of the green band indicates that acquisitions were relatively more common for startups founded during this time.\nFor startups founded after roughly 2000, the closed share becomes more prominent.This suggests that among the firms with known outcomes, closure becomes increasingly common in more recent years. Finally, for the most recent cohorts, particularly those founded after 2010, the chart shows an overwhelming share classified as “operating.” This should not be interpreted as greater success; rather, these startups are simply too young to have reached an exit event, resulting in a near-100% operating classification by default.\n\n\nCode\n# Get top 5 markets\ntop_markets &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  count(market, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 6) |&gt;\n  pull(market)\n\n# shorten market labels slightly (important)\nmosaic_data &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(market %in% top_markets) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    market = str_replace_all(market, \" \", \"\\n\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(market, status)\n\ntbl &lt;- table(mosaic_data$market, mosaic_data$status)\n\n# Increase margins but not excessively\npar(mar = c(6, 6, 3, 3))\n\nmosaicplot(\n  tbl,\n  color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = ncol(tbl), \"Set2\"),\n  main = \"Outcome Mix Varies Across Major Startup Markets\",\n  xlab = \"Market\",\n  ylab = \"Proportion within Each Market\",\n  las = 1,\n  cex.axis = 0.65,   # smaller tick labels\n  cex.lab  = 1.0,   # axis labels readable\n  cex.main = 1.2    # title not overpowering\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all five markets, operating startups make up the largest share, indicating that most startups in these sectors have not yet reached a definitive exit event. However, the relative shares of acquired and closed startups vary meaningfully by market.\nBiotechnology, E-Commerce, Mobile, and Software all show a similar pattern: a modest share of acquisitions at the top, a relatively small proportion of closures in the middle, and a dominant base of operating firms. These industries tend to have long development cycles (Biotech), high growth potential (Mobile, Software), and frequent acquisition activity (Software, E-Commerce), which may help explain the moderate levels of successful exits.\nCurated Web, however, stands out obviosuly. It has a much higher proportion of closed startups compared to the other markets, indicating greater volatility or lower long-term sustainability in this category. The smaller operating share suggests that many firms in this niche fail to survive long enough to be acquired or to continue operating.\nIn the end, this mosaic plot highlights that while most startups remain active across markets, the risk of failure is much higher in the Curated Web space, but industries like Software, Mobile, and Biotechnology exhibit stronger operating persistence and relatively greater acquisition activity.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggalluvial)\n\nstartup_alluvial &lt;- startup |&gt;\n  filter(\n    !is.na(founded_year),\n    !is.na(funding_rounds),\n    !is.na(status)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    status = factor(\n      status,\n      levels = c(\"operating\", \"acquired\", \"closed\", \"ipo\")\n    ),\n    \n    founded_period = cut(\n      founded_year,\n      breaks = c(1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020),\n      labels = c(\"1990–1999\", \"2000–2004\", \"2005–2008\",\n                 \"2009–2011\", \"2012–2014\"),\n      include.lowest = TRUE,\n      right = FALSE\n    ),\n    \n    rounds_bucket = case_when(\n      funding_rounds == 0     ~ \"0 rounds\",\n      funding_rounds == 1     ~ \"1 round\",\n      funding_rounds %in% 2:3 ~ \"2–3 rounds\",\n      funding_rounds &gt;= 4     ~ \"4+ rounds\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  drop_na(founded_period, rounds_bucket)\n\ngg_alluvial &lt;- ggplot(\n  startup_alluvial,\n  aes(\n    axis1 = founded_period,\n    axis2 = rounds_bucket,\n    axis3 = status,\n    y     = ..count..\n  )\n) +\n  geom_alluvium(\n    aes(fill = status),\n    width = 1/10,\n    alpha = 0.85\n  ) +\n  geom_stratum(\n    width  = 1/5,\n    fill   = \"grey92\",\n    color  = \"grey50\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    stat = \"stratum\",\n    aes(\n      label = after_stat(stratum),\n      y = after_stat(y)\n    ),\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    size  = 3.0,\n    color = \"grey25\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette, drop = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    limits = c(\"Founded period\", \"Funding rounds\", \"Final status\"),\n    expand = c(.10, .05)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Funding Trajectories and Outcomes Differ Across Startup Cohorts\",\n    subtitle = \"Founding period, funding intensity, and final startup status\",\n    x        = NULL,\n    y        = \"Number of startups\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title      = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle   = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.y     = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid      = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title    = element_blank()\n  )\n\ngg_alluvial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alluvial plot illustrates how startups transition from their founding period to different levels of funding intensity and ultimately to their final outcomes. The more recent cohorts, particularly those founded between 2009 and 2011, form the thickest streams, indicating that startup formation accelerated significantly in the post-2008 tech boom. Across all cohorts, the majority of startups receive only a single funding round, and only a small fraction progress to two or three rounds, with an even smaller group reaching four or more rounds. This pattern reflects the steep funnel of venture funding: many companies raise initial capital, but relatively few sustain investor support through later stages.\nThe funding pathways are strongly correlated with outcomes. Startups receiving only one round tend to remain operating but also make up a large share of closures, suggesting that many early-stage firms struggle to maintain momentum. Those with two or three rounds exhibit a more balanced distribution across operating, acquired, and closed outcomes, indicating that this middle group is competitive enough to move toward some form of exit—positive or negative. The highest funding category, four or more rounds, shows the strongest flow toward acquisitions (no closure records), highlighting that sustained funding is a strong marker of eventual acquisition potential. Closures appear across all funding levels but are concentrated among companies with one or two rounds. Despite these differences, the operating category remains the plurality across all groups, particularly for the most recent cohorts whose outcomes may still be unfolding.\n\n\nCode\nstartup_facet &lt;- startup |&gt; \n  filter(funding_total_usd &gt; 0, !is.na(funding_rounds), !is.na(status)) |&gt; \n  mutate( rounds_bucket = case_when( \n    funding_rounds == 0 ~ \"0 rounds\", \n    funding_rounds == 1 ~ \"1 round\", \n    funding_rounds %in% 2:3 ~ \"2–3 rounds\", \n    funding_rounds &gt;= 4 ~ \"4+ rounds\", \n    TRUE ~ NA_character_ ), \n    rounds_bucket = factor( \n      rounds_bucket, \n      levels = c(\"0 rounds\", \"1 round\", \"2–3 rounds\", \"4+ rounds\") \n      ) \n    ) %&gt;% drop_na(rounds_bucket)\n\ngg_facet_funding_rounds &lt;- ggplot(\n  startup_facet,\n  aes(x = rounds_bucket, y = funding_total_usd, fill = status)\n) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    width = 0.65,\n    color = \"grey30\",\n    outlier.alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = status_palette) +\n  scale_y_log10(\n    labels = label_number(\n      prefix    = \"$\",\n      scale_cut = cut_si(\"\"),\n      accuracy  = 1\n    )\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ status, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"More Funding Rounds Are Associated with Larger Total Investments\",\n    subtitle = \"Distribution of total funding by number of rounds, shown separately by startup outcome\",\n    x        = \"Number of funding rounds\",\n    y        = \"Total funding (USD, log scale)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title      = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle   = element_text(size = 10),\n    strip.text      = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11),\n    axis.text.x     = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.y     = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\ngg_facet_funding_rounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all three outcome categories, the same core pattern appears: startups that raise more rounds tend to receive substantially larger total investments.\nFor acquired startups, funding increases consistently as firms progress from one round to 2–3 rounds to 4+ rounds. Acquired firms with 4+ rounds have the highest median funding levels in the entire chart, suggesting that sustained investment is strongly associated with eventual acquisition—likely reflecting investor confidence, growth potential, or strategic value.\nAmong closed startups, a similar but less pronounced pattern emerges. Startups that ultimately fail still show higher funding levels when they raise more rounds, indicating that even firms that eventually shut down may attract significant capital before their failure becomes evident. However, their distributions remain below those of acquired firms, reinforcing that higher funding alone does not guarantee success.\nFor operating startups, total funding also increases with additional rounds, and their median funding levels for 2–3 and 4+ rounds approach those of acquired firms. This suggests that many actively operating firms remain well-capitalized and could still be on a trajectory toward future exits.\nLastly, we could tell that more funding rounds correspond to much larger total funding amounts, regardless of a startup’s eventual outcome. What differs by outcome is the typical funding level: acquired firms tend to sit at the top of the funding distribution, while closed firms occupy the lower end, with operating firms in between. This pattern reflects both the selection effects of venture capital and the financial trajectories associated with different startup futures.",

    "text": "This exploration highlights how startup growth, funding behavior, and eventual outcomes intertwine in ways that reflect both the momentum of the tech ecosystem and the realities of entrepreneurial risk. The data show a dramatic rise in new ventures during the 2000s, especially in software and biotech, and while most startups remain operating, those that succeed through acquisition typically secure more capital and endure more funding rounds. Markets differ in maturity and exit patterns, and older cohorts naturally show more acquisitions and closures simply because they have had more time to evolve. At the same time, the analysis is constrained by incomplete records—particularly missing founding years and funding details—which limits our ability to draw causal conclusions. Future work could incorporate survival analysis, geographic comparisons, or firm-level characteristics to better understand the forces that shape startup trajectories. Overall, the results provide a descriptive map of how the startup landscape develops over time, offering a foundation for deeper investigation into what drives venture success and persistence.",
