# Conclusion
This exploration highlights how startup growth, funding behavior, and eventual outcomes intertwine in ways that reflect both the momentum of the tech ecosystem and the realities of entrepreneurial risk. The data show a dramatic rise in new ventures during the 2000s, especially in software and biotech, and while most startups remain operating, those that succeed through acquisition typically secure more capital and endure more funding rounds. Markets differ in maturity and exit patterns, and older cohorts naturally show more acquisitions and closures simply because they have had more time to evolve. At the same time, the analysis is constrained by incomplete records—particularly missing founding years and funding details—which limits our ability to draw causal conclusions. Future work could incorporate survival analysis, geographic comparisons, or firm-level characteristics to better understand the forces that shape startup trajectories. Overall, the results provide a descriptive map of how the startup landscape develops over time, offering a foundation for deeper investigation into what drives venture success and persistence.
