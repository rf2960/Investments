# Conclusion
This exploratory analysis reveals that startup outcomes are closely associated with a combination of founding time, funding intensity, and market context, with older and more heavily funded startups more likely to experience acquisition or closure, while newer cohorts remain predominantly operating. At the same time, the findings should be interpreted cautiously due to several limitations, including survivorship and censoring effects in younger firms, substantial missingness in funding-related variables, and the use of aggregated lifetime funding measures that obscure timing and valuation dynamics. Future analyses could extend this work by incorporating longitudinal funding data, firm age explicitly, or external market indicators to better capture temporal and contextual influences on startup trajectories. Overall, this project underscores the value of careful exploratory data analysis, particularly thoughtful visualization and data quality assessment, as a tool for uncovering structural patterns, assessing data limitations, and guiding more rigorous follow-up studies.
