### Render the book (RStudio)

- [ ] 1. If you haven't already, click "Help" "Check for Updates" to make sure you have the latest version of RStudio (and thus have Quarto installed.)

- [ ] 2. Render the web site locally by clicking the "Build" tap on the right and then "Render Book".

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `docs/index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub.
      
- [ ] 5. Check that the rendered site looks correct on GitHub and that the links back to GitHub (icon on top left, edit this page / report an issue on right) work properly. Note that there is a delay between the time you push the files and when they show up on your sitel You can check the progress by clicking the Actions tab.

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book on GitHub Pages.)

### Update README (GitHub or RStudio)

- [ ] 1. Delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project in its place. If you're working locally, be sure to commit and push the changes to GitHub.

### Optional

- [ ] 1. Choose a theme from [https://bootswatch.com/](https://bootswatch.com/) and replace "cosmo" in `_quarto.yml` with your prefered theme.
