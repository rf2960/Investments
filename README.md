This project explores patterns in startup formation, funding, and outcomes using a large startup dataset from Crunchbase. 

Through a series of exploratory data visualizations, the analysis examines how startup outcomes vary across markets, founding cohorts, and funding trajectories. 

The goal is to provide an interpretable, reproducible overview of startup dynamics—highlighting how time, capital intensity, and industry context shape observed outcomes—without relying on predictive modeling. 

All figures are designed for a nontechnical audience and emphasize clear storytelling and best practices in data visualization.
